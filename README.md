# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclist Case Study 2023

Welcome to the Bike Share Data Analytics Project repository! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from a hypothetical bike sharing company to gain insights into rider trends and preferences. The project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics course's capstone project.

## Project Overview
This project aims to consolidate and analyze bike sharing data over 12 months using R language. The primary goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to rider behavior and preferences. The visualizations provide a clear understanding of various aspects of the bike sharing system.
